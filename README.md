# IWasThere
An app for college football fans to document games they have attended. Users can select the teams who played, date, and location of the game.  This is the bare MVP. Realistic stretch goals will include:  -Ability for user to add the score and embed YouTube video with highlights of the game.  -Ability for user to add link to box score of the game as well as any game stories. -Ability for user to add own personal photos from the game (tailgating, game photos, family photos and memories from the game) All in all, the excitement of college football rests in so much more than the game itself. It's in the tradition and pageantry surrounding the game -- Tailgating, families who plan wedding and family vacations around the football season, and so much more. I hope this app can capture those moments for users/fans.
